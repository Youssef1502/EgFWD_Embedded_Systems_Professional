# EgFWD On-demand Traffic Light Control project
This is an On-demand Traffic light control system for the EgFWD Embedded Systems Professional NanoDegree Scholarship. This project was written in C using Microchip Studio and Proteus 8 professional.

## Demonstration

Here, I used Proteus 8 Professional in order to simulate AVR Atmega32. I have the wiring labeled below. <br></br>

## System Functionality
- The main system handles 6 LEDs and 2 Secondary LEDs
- Car LEDs switch every 10s (each switch includes 5s yellow light blinking interval)
- `Button`: the button acts as a request for a pedestrian to cross the street
  * The system will stop cars if not already on red light as per request

## Details & Program Flow Chart
You can find system details and program flow chart in project documentation [here](https://github.com/FahdSeddik/ESND-On-demand-Traffic-light-control/blob/main/Project%20Documentation.pdf).
